# Draw by Days [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/SketchingDev/Draw-by-Days.svg?branch=development)](https://travis-ci.org/SketchingDev/Draw-by-Days)

Draw-by-days is a project to provide artists (amateur or professional) with a daily reminder to practise
their artistry against a catalogue of customisable reference material.

Aside from hopefully being a useful platform for artists, it provides me with practical experience iteratively 
developing a micro-service project with all the latest technologies!

## Functionality

The functionality that has been added so far:

 * **As an** artist **I want** to view reference material **so that** I can practise drawing a subject

## Services

Each directory is an isolated service with its own code-base, component tests, build management and deployment 
scripts.

 * `website/` - [README](website/README.md) - Front-end website allowing basic navigation through a small sub-set of 
 reference images.
